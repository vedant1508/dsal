1. Consider telephone book database of N clients. Make use of a hash table implementation
to quickly look up client‘s telephone number. Make use of two collision handling
techniques and compare them using number of comparisons required to find a set of
telephone numbers.

2. To create ADT that implement the &quot;set&quot; concept.
a. Add (new Element) -Place a value into the set , b. Remove (element) Remove the value
c. Contains (element) Return true if element is in collection, d. Size () Return number of
values in collection Iterator () Return an iterator used to loop over collection, e.
Intersection of two sets , f. Union of two sets, g. Difference between two sets, h. Subset.

3. Beginning with an empty binary search tree, Construct binary search tree by inserting the
values in the order given. After constructing a binary tree -
i. Insert new node, ii. Find number of nodes in longest path from root, iii. Minimum data
value found in the tree, iv. Change a tree so that the roles of the left and right pointers are
swapped at every node, v. Search a value.

4. Construct an expression tree from the given prefix expression eg. +--a*bc/def and
traverse it using post order traversal (non recursive) and then delete the entire tree.

5. A Dictionary stores keywords and its meanings. Provide facility for adding new
keywords, deleting keywords, updating values of any entry. Provide facility to display
whole data sorted in ascending/ Descending order. Also find how many maximum
comparisons may require for finding any keyword. Use Binary Search Tree for
implementation.

6. There are flight paths between cities. If there is a flight between city A and city B then
there is an edge between the cities. The cost of the edge can be the time that flight take to
reach city B from A, or the amount of fuel used for the journey. Represent this as a graph.
The node can be represented by airport name or name of the city. Use adjacency list
representation of the graph or use adjacency matrix representation of the graph. Check
whether the graph is connected or not. Justify the storage representation used.

7. You have a business with several offices; you want to lease phone lines to connect them
up with each other; and the phone company charges different amounts of money to
connect different pairs of cities. You want a set of lines that connects all your offices with
a minimum total cost. Solve the problem by suggesting appropriate data structures.

8. Given sequence k = k1 &lt;k2 &lt; … &lt;kn of n sorted keys, with a search probability pi for
each key ki . Build the Binary search tree that has the least search cost given the access
probability for each key?

9. A Dictionary stores keywords and its meanings. Provide facility for adding new
keywords, deleting keywords, updating values of any entry. Provide facility to display
whole data sorted in ascending/ Descending order. Also find how many maximum
comparisons may require for finding any keyword. Use Height balance tree and find the
complexity for finding a keyword.

10. Consider a scenario for Hospital to cater services to different kinds of patients as Serious
(top priority), b) non-serious (medium priority), c) General Checkup (Least priority).
Implement the priority queue to cater services to the patients.

11. Department maintains a student information. The file contains roll number, name,
division and address. Allow user to add, delete information of student. Display
information of particular employee. If record of student does not exist an appropriate
message is displayed. If it is, then the system displays the student details. Use sequential
file to main the data.

12. Company maintains employee information as employee ID, name, designation and salary.
Allow user to add, delete information of employee. Display information of particular
employee. If employee does not exist an appropriate message is displayed. If it is, then
the system displays the employee details. Use index sequential file to maintain the data.

12. Implementation of a direct access file -Insertion and deletion of a record from a direct
access file.
